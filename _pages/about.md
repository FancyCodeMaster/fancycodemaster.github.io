Welcome to my personal website! I am an AI Researcher and NLP Developer currently working full-time at [Ekghanti Services](https://ekghanti.com.np), Kathmandu. I specialize in developing solutions for speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. 

### About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Pokhara University](https://pu.edu.np). During my studies, I focused on topics such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software development, which led me to my current role in AI and NLP research.

I am passionate about:

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Designing models for multi-lingual and mixed-language environments.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Building voice synthesis systems capable of producing natural, expressive speech.

### Current Work

At Ekghanti Services, I work on projects involving:

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Fine-tuning models like Whisper for local languages such as Nepali.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Building voice synthesis systems capable of producing natural, expressive speech.
- **Data Engine** : Building Data Engine to automate the machine learning lifecycle from data collection to labeling to training, evaluation and deployment of the models.

This site serves as a hub for my work, publications, and blog posts. I am excited to share my journey in AI research and NLP development!

Feel free to browse through the sections for my latest projects, contributions, and updates.
